Elm Shopping Cart Example 
========================

### Motivation
This is a minimal, frontend-only shopping cart experience written with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) 0.17. My intention with it was to learn a bit more about Elm by forcing myself to code something slightly more complex than the Counter example in the Elm docs. 

### Dev
This assumes that youâ€™re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/).

Clone the repo, run `npm install && npm run dev` and accept elm-package's prompt in the cli. Changes to your styles and elm modules under the `src` directory will auto-transpile to css and js respectively.


### Next steps

* Revise with most idiomatic approaches
* Add url navigation
* Add shopping cart data persistence
* Add form validation
* Add tests
